          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not so
          more, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up fo
          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
          12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
          I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from
